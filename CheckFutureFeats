When doing prediction of future values in time series using models like LSTM, 
sometimes there is a mistake in preparation of data that future values are unexpectedly
put into the feature set for prediction. This is generally not good as we want to use only known (past) feats 
till the time t to predict values at later times. So how to check if our prepared data for training has added wrong future values in the feature set.

Note: We do not cover the exception that sometimes we can use predicted values of a time series to predict future values of another time series.

The trick is easy!

# 1. We import necessary packages.
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# 2. We can create a dummy pd dataframe with a value column growing along with time. Index is made with time = 0 to n
x = np.arange(0,1000,1)
df = pd.DataFrame(data=x, columns=["Values"])

# 3. We use this df in our preparation function (assume you already have this function, and you want to test if it used future values in the feature set)
# for deep learning models. 
# We assume that first many columns of df2 are features and the rest are target values.
df2 = data_prep(df)

# 4. We calculate the difference between index and column values.
for column in df2.columns:
    df2[column] = df2.index - df2[column]
    
# 5. Check the feats if they include future values. feat_nums is the number of features.
# If this returns an empty array, then we don't use future values as features.
np.where( df2[df2.columns[:feat_nums]].values < 0 )

# 6. We are also able to check the targets if they have past values inside as well.
# If this returns an empty array, this passes.
np.where( df2[df2.columns[feat_nums:]].values > 0 )
